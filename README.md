1. Retrieve air pollution data from a free API.
2. Analyze this data by combining it with provided demographic and geographic data.
3. Present the results in an interactive dashboard.

## Deliverables

- **Data Collection and Analysis Program**: Documented source code and execution instructions.
- **Analysis Report**: A document describing the data used, the methodology, the analyses performed, and the conclusions.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A visual presentation of the results, including maps, charts, and other interactive elements.

## Evaluation

Your work will be evaluated based on:

- The quality and accuracy of the data retrieved.
